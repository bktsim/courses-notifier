# courses-notifier

This application is capable of tracking restricted and general seats for UBC classes. 
The application checks for available seats every n seconds, and pings the user by sending a message via a Discord webhook into a private channel if a seat is available.

* The application in `course-notifier-gs` with the `.gs` extension is a script that can be deployed on Google Apps Script and used with Triggers.
* The application in `course-notifier-py` can be used locally on a computer. 
* The application in `heroku-course` is based on python, and can be deployed on the Heroku platform with a Free Dyno. It is the most "sophisticated" version based on OOP and the observer pattern. Much more scalable for multiple users.

**Note:** This project is not intended for actual use - it is just a fun project I decided to create during my free time.
